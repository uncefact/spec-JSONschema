# UN/CEFACT JSON Schema draft 2020-12 publication

This directory contains JSON schema artefacts. They are fully based on the JSON schema draft 2020-12. This means that they fully comply with the requirements of OpenAPI 3.1.x.

In the [library](https://github.com/uncefact/spec-JSONschema/tree/main/compatability/library) directory, the UN/CEFACT reference data models are provided in the library variant. This means that all contextualisations of the base classes can be reproduced. Thus, in addition to the basic data types, it also contains the business messages derived from the respective master messages. These can be further contextualised during implementation if required. 

In the [snapshot](https://github.com/uncefact/spec-JSONschema/tree/main/compatability/snapshot) directory, the UN/CEFACT reference data models and the message structures are provided in the snapshot variant. This means that all contextualisations of the base classes have been fully applied. Each JSON schema artefact is consequently a standalone variant that contains all the required data structures and code lists. These can be further contextualised or extended as needed during implementation.
