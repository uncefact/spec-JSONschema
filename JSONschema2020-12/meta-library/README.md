# UN/CEFACT JSON Schema draft 2020-12 meta-library publication

## Introduction

This directory contains JSON schema artefacts. They are fully based on the JSON schema draft 2020-12.
This means that they fully comply with the requirements of OpenAPI 3.1.x.  

The UN/CEFACT reference data models are provided in the library variant, with extended meta-information.  
This means that an individual meta-schema and an additional vocabulary is applied. The additional information
is included to support mapping-processes and the JSON-LD vocabulary creation.

## Basic schema design principles

<a name="basicPrinciples" />
Basic rules of the UN/CEFACT Core Component Library can be [found here.](https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/ccts) The version CCTS 2.01 is applied.
In the linked PDF document abbreviations like ABIE, BBIE etc. are explained in detail.

The following figure shows how the different CCTS classes are interlinked and can be extended.

### Basic Components

<a name="basicComponents" />The lowest level provides all basic data types used throughout the complete Core Component Library. The include four different types of data types:

#### Primitive data types (PDT)

<a name="pdt" />The PDT summarize the representations of those types that are the foundation for all other data types. 
They include
1. __binaryType__  
to represent base64 encoded representation of binary information

2. __booleanType__
3. __decimalType__  
This type is defined to restrict a string to a pattern representing decimal representations of numbers. 
The JSON built-in numeric data type is not suitable when exchanging numbers that need to be uses as calculation
basis e.g. for prices, amounts, taxes, wages including roundings with the needed precision. Using only the standard JSON
numeric datatypes for those scenarios will lead to issues especially with rounding and accurracy.
4. __integerType__
5. __stringType__

PDTs are normally not used directly in any Core Component libary object. Moreover, they [UDTs](#udt) are used instead that amend the PDTs.

#### Unqualified data types (UDT)

<a name="udt" />UDTs are the real basic data types used in the Core Component library. They combine the value itself 
with supplementary components (SCs), where needed to bring the value into the correct context.

1. __amountType__ 
This type is used to represent all kind of amounts. 
2. __binaryObjectType__
3. __codeType__
4. __dateTimeType__
5. __dateType__
6. __graphicType__
7. __idType__
8. __indicatorType__
9. __measureType__
10. __numericType__
11. __percentType__
12. __pictureType__
13. __quantityType__
14. __rateType__
15. __soundType__
16. __textType__
17. __timeType__
18. __valueType__
19. __videoType__



## JSON filenames and sub-folder structure

<a name="jsonFilenames" />

* All files originally published by UN/CEFACT start with the prefix __UNECE__. Files, like code lists, that origin 
  from other standardisation organisations start with their naming abbreviation, i.e. __ISO__.
* The json schema file containing all basic components is named __UNECE-BasicComponents.json__
* All Reference Data Models (RDMs) and their contextualisations _end_ with the suffix __ContextCCL__.  
  The following files are representations of the official published RDMs. All other files ending with ContextCCL 
  are subsets of the corresponding RDMs.
    * Buy Ship Pay RDM: __UNECE-BSPContextCCL.json__
    * Multi Modal Transport RDM: __UNECE-MMTContextCCL.json__
    * Supply Chain RDM: __UNECE-SCRDMContextCCL.json__
    * Cross Border Management RDM: __UNECE-CBMContextCCL.json__
    * Pay RDM: __UNECE-PAYContextCCL.json__
    * eCertification RDM: __UNECE-eCertContextCCL.json__
    * Sustainable Development and Circular Economy RDM: __UNECE-SDCEContextCCL.json__
    * Experience Program RDM: __UNECE-EPContextCCL.json__
* All business documents (messages) are based on so called master-messages for the corresponding RDM. 
  All master message structures have a suffix __Master__.  
  For example the master message structure where all other business document structures are derived from
  is named __UNECE-BSPMaster.json__.
* All other json schema files with no special suffix are representations of business document message 
  structures. For example is the __UNECE-CrossIndustryInvoice.json__ the json schema represenation of
  the Cross Industry Invoice business document structure.
* Code lists are stored in the sub-folder __codelists__. A few code lists are not published in this library.
  The list can be found in the corresponding __error.log__ file.


## What is this meta-library ?

<a name="metaLibrary" />
The meta library exports adds some meta information in the JSON schema files. Those are especially provided to allow 
an interoperabel usage in conjunction with the JSON LD vocabulary.

The corresponding [meta-schema definition can be found here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uncefact/spec-JSONschema/main/JSONschema2020-12/meta-schema). 

The library export creates one JSON schema file for each level of contextualisation as they are defined
by the UN/CEFACT standards. It creates one large CCL JSON schema representation as a foundation.
On top of it, it creates one JSON schema file contextualising and restricting the CCL to the defined
RDMs and document-centric structures. Each level may already use restricted data types that are
restricted exactly at that level. This needs to be considered when creating this type of export.


### Pro
The complete CCL, all RDMs as well as all (document-centric) message structure definitions are exported
as defined by UN/CEFACT standards. A maximum of re-usable data structures and definitions are created.
It assures by design that any implementation is consistent and ready for any process-amendment. 

### Contra
Any implementation needs to handle the huge CCL library as a base import as well as the 
multi-layer-restrictions as they are defined by UN/CEFACT standards. For example, the eCMR message is
defined as a contextualisation of a master message structure for all document-centric messages defined
by UN/CEFACT. The contained data structure is process specific contextualisation of a multi modal
transport reference data model. The MMT-RDM is a transport specific contextualisation of the Buy-Ship-Pay
reference data model. Moreover, this again is a contextualisation of the underlying CCL. 

Thus, an implementation could get rather complex while at the same time achieving a maximum compliance level. 

### Meta-Schema Extensions

<a name="metaExtensions" />
This export is an extended version of the library export. Additional meta information in the UN/CEFACT context is provided. This includes:
* The CCL entity type (e.g. ABIE, BBIE)
* The UN-ID, which uniquely identified each individual entity of the CCL. It is useful for example for mapping-purposes.
* The business process according to the CCL.
* The TDED, where applicable.

In order to support this export-type a meta schema is created extending JSON schema. The following properties are defined in this meta-schema:

	"properties": {
	  "uncefact:type": { 
	    "type": "string",
	      "enum": ["AggregateBIE", "AssociationBIE", "BasicBIE"]
	    },
	    "uncefact:unId": { "type": "string"	},
	    "uncefact:tded": { "type": "string" },
	    "uncefact:businessProcess": { "type": "string" }
	}

### Links to other export variants

<a name="exportLinks" />
In the [library](https://github.com/uncefact/spec-JSONschema/tree/main/JSON-Schema2020-12/library) directory, 
the UN/CEFACT reference data models are provided in the library variant without the meta-schema extension.

In the [subset](https://github.com/uncefact/spec-JSONschema/tree/main/JSON-Schema2020-12/subset) directory, 
only the UN/CEFACT reference data models, but no message structures are provided in a subset variant. This means 
that all contextualisations of the base classes have been fully applied.  

In the [snapshot](https://github.com/uncefact/spec-JSONschema/tree/main/JSON-Schema2020-12/snapshot) directory, 
the UN/CEFACT reference data models and the message structures are provided in the snapshot variant. This means 
that all contextualisations of the base classes have been fully applied. Each JSON schema artefact is 
consequently a standalone variant that contains all the required data structures and code lists. These can be 
further contextualised or extended as needed during implementation.
